# get-neighbors.py

>Python script to find the phonological neighbors of a list of words, using the deletion, addition, substitution rule ("DAS," Luce & Pisoni, 1998).

Work in progress. Documentation will be written as the project develops.

This will use the [IPhOD database](http://iphod.com) (Vaden, Halpin, & Hickok,
2009), but any corpus can be used, following certain criteria (TBD).
